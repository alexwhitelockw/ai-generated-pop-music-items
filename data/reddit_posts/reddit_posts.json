    "post_text": "Hey everyone!\nLately we've all been hearing a strong resurgence of '80s synth-pop sounds in a lot of current pop music, artists like Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus, and even Marina's last record, have been diving into that 80's and even disco 70's neon-drenched, dramatic, synth-heavy aesthetic. Big synths + glossy production.\n\nBut honestly\u2026 doesn\u2019t it feel like Carly Rae Jepsen was way ahead of the curve?\n\nHer album \"E\u2022MO\u2022TION\" (and even \"Kiss\"), was a cult classic of retro euphoria that wasn\u2019t really \u201ccool\u201d at all, at the time, but now it feels like a blueprint for female singers. She blended \u201880s sonics with real emotional depth, and even though it didn\u2019t dominate the charts, it built a loyal following that clearly inspired a lot of the current soundscape in pop. Even her later work, like \"Dedicated\" and \"The Loneliest Time\", continues in that vein but with more sophistication.\n\nI feel like she lowkey walked so this whole new synth-pop generation could run, but people usually don't give her the credit she deserves.\n\nWould love to know what others think:\n\nDo you think Carly gets enough credit for influencing this movement?\n\nEDIT: I am NOT saying by any means she started it (as some people understood). I'm just saying she was a PIONEER in modern culture exploring and keeping a consistent sound that's what current artists have been doing. That's all! Hugs for everyone! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc"

    "post_text": "This year with the release of *Eusexua* and *Virgin* I couldn't help but notice FKA twigs and Lorde be criticised online for being pretentious, this was even before the '\"where are the thinkers\" quote by twigs. I want to know what people think about pretentiousness when it comes to pop music because I think there is a place for it and that it can push pop music to places it would otherwise not go. Sometimes it's ok to take pop music seriously or even too seriously. I do think it's funny how certain artists are perceived as pretentious and others are not, for example personally I think Lady Gaga is the most pretentious popstar in modern pop music and I love her for that but I didn't really see that conversation happening with the release of *Mayhem*. I do also think calling a female artist pretentious can be used in a misogynistic way to downplay a woman's intelligence. Anyway what do you think about it? I think it's an interesting conversation to have."

    "post_title": "One year ago today, Charli XCX released the Girl, So Confusing remix featuring Lorde",
    "post_text": "Back in 2013, English singer Charli XCX burst on the scene with her debut album *True Romance* on April 13, 2013 shortly after already being featured on the hit song \u201cI Love It.\u201d Over five months later, New Zealander singer Lorde also burst on the scene with her debut album *Pure Heroine* that was released on September 27, 2013 and came packed with her mega chart topper \u201cRoyals.\u201d For the next 11 years the two artists would be constantly compared by various outlets in the media and even pitted against one another as their careers progressed. It would also get to both artists mentally as they had their insecurities about how the other was doing compared to themselves. When the original version of the song came out on the Charli\u2019s critically acclaimed album *Brat*, fan speculation exploded into various debates on if the song was a diss track from Charli aimed directly at Lorde. In actuality, the song was actually a tribute to Lorde and she was the inspiration behind the track. Charli contacted Lorde to do a remix of the song a day before *Brat* came out. Charli was prepared to get denied by Lorde but she heard the song before she got Charli\u2019s message due to the time zone differences. They then together worked it out on the remix and put out what many consider to be one of the best, if not the best, song of the jam-packed music year that was 2024.\n\nThe remix, accompanied by the mirrored reflection art cover, explore themes of insecurities, jealousy, and forced role-playing by the greater powers at hand. Lorde in particular expresses her years-long battle with obesophobia and her issues with self-confidence in being pitted to be like Charli. Charli on the other hand expresses her envy of Lorde and doing everything to try and be like her for years since she was always compared to her. It truly became a meeting of the mods between two side of the same coin.\n\nThe song was critically acclaimed upon release gaining several distinctions included the coveted \u201cBest New Music\u201d honor from Pitchfork and ended up being either Number 1 or in the Top 5 of several year-end lists for the best songs of 2024. All in all, the song represented the anticipated delivery of two very similar artists pitted against each other by a ruthless industry to finally make peace and express their true feelings defiantly for the whole music industry and world to witness\n\nHere are some questions for discussion to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Charli XCX\u2019s Girl, So Confusing remix featuring Lorde\n\n1. What are your thoughts on the remix today? \n2. Has your opinion on the remix changed at all in the past year since it came out?\n3. Would like Charli XCX and Lorde to collaborate again in the future or is the remix too perfect that it should not be tainted with more collaborations? \n4. How would you rank this remix amongst both Charli XCX and Lorde\u2019s other pieces of work?\n5. What do you believe, if any, will be the lasting legacy of the remix?"

    "post_text": "It's really getting ridiculous. In basically every comment section about her, there are people saying that she's bought and paid for good reviews, that there's people from her PR team in the comments, that her persona is a result of some shadow creative team, etc. I don't get why she's the victim of this more than anyone else in the current pop landscape. Factually, her entire album was produced and written by herself, Elvira, and Luka, and that's it, other than one more woman helping write High Fashion and an interlude. It's not some massive creative team where Addison is just the figurehead.\n\nI just don't get why people are incapable of thinking that other people just genuinely enjoy her music. I don't enjoy anything from Taylor Swift on her most recent album but I don't think that the people who do enjoy it are all paid shills, despite Taylor having more than enough money to do that. You're allowed to dislike things, but that doesn't mean everyone else secretly dislikes it too. Personally, I have at least half a dozen friends in real life who enjoy Addison's music, and to my knowledge, none of us have received a single cent from her. Maybe this thinking is due to the current conspiratorial cultural zeitgeist led by conservatives that believe that everyone against them are shills? \n\nThis is not an excuse to leave lazy comments about how you just don't like the album or about how she \"feels\" fake without any more explanation.\n\ne: another good point against her being payola is the fact that Diet Pepsi had some of the most organic chart success I've seen in a long time: slow rise to a peak, slow fall down, over a span of months: https://www.mystreamcount.com/track/6MzofobZt2dm0Kf1hTThFz\n\ne2: a lot of people in this thread refusing to do a modicum of research to find out that she isn't a trump supporter anymore, disavowed him, endorsed kamala, and posted multiple detailed discussions about how her past actions were wrong\n\ne3: apparently this thread turned into a debate of \"is Addison good or not\" which is exactly what I didn't want it to turn into. gonna ask the mods to lock the post because apparently y'all can't read"

Mariah was one of my gay idols and really helped me come into my own during adulthood. I was such a fan of MTV and decided to take my best friend to see TRL that summer.\n\nOn the day of filming, we were quickly ushered into a giant group after hours of waiting outside MTV Studios very early in the morning. Me and my friend were picked to appear in studio for unknown reasons.\n\nWhile the countdown played Jennifer Lopez & Ja Rule\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Real,\u201d producers directed the audience that a special guest would be appearing and that we should all keep quiet for her entrance.\n\nWhen we heard Mariah\u2019s vocals, we instantly started screaming along with everyone around us. Mariah pushed out the ice cream cart and it was history from there.\n\nInterestingly enough, when Carson Daily threw to break, we were instructed to keep quiet, but Mariah was instantly talking to fans and carrying on. Carson looked annoyed but nobody cared because Mariah freaking Carey was in the room.\n\nThe \u201cmeltdown\u201d happened and Mariah left the set without return. Mariah seemed surprised during that commercial break that Carson acted like she wasn\u2019t supposed to appear on the show.\n\nNever once did me or my friend think that Mariah was crazy or having a breakdown. She just seemed to be having a good time, as to her, she was supposed to appear on the show.\n\nOverall, that\u2019s one of the best days of my life. Me and my friend were near the back of the audience, and without an archive of the full episode it\u2019s hard to spot us on camera. I smiled for weeks knowing that I had seen Mariah Carey in person (holy shit she\u2019s stunning).\n\nIf anyone has a full archive of that episode, I would love to have it for my personal memories!"

    "post_text": "Many of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 (which updates weekly) were released more than a year ago. 5 in the top 10.With the exception of Bad Bunny's DtMF at 800 million streams, there are no 2025 songs close to hitting a billion on Spotify. The #2 most streamed song of the year is Ordinary by Alex Warren, at around 600 million, and #6, the second English song in the top 10,  is Abracadabra by Lady Gaga, with less than 500 million streams.\n\nBy July of last year, Beautiful Things by Benson Boone had surpassed a billion,  and Espresso was close to reaching this milestone. The Billboard Top 10 in this week of 2024 only had 1 old song on it.\n\nEven artists who seem to be getting a lot of 'hype' in 2025, like Addison Rae, Lorde, and Katseye, have made little to no impact on the charts, and haven't broken any notable streaming records, either. Even more weirdly, despite Morgan Wallen's unwavering presence on on the Billboard Hot 100, none of his new songs have cracked 200 million streams, which seems odd in this day and age where basically everyone has Spotify.\n\nI don't think 2025 music is bad. I actually like a lot of it. Mayhem and Addison were two of my favorite albums of the past few years. But it seems like for some reason, 2025 music isn't catching on with the general public, and I don't know why. I actually don't think it has anything to do with the state of US politics; there have been difficult times like this before that didn't lead to such extreme chart stagnation. Bot to mention during hard times music is often turned to as a form of escapism, and thus viewed as more important, rather than less.\n\nWas it just that 2024 music was so good that people would rather keep listening to that than to check out new things? But even then, 2024 songs haven't been growing *that much* in streams. Die With A Smile, Espresso, and Birds of A Feather have been at 2 billion something for months. I'm genuinely curious to hear your thoughts about the state of 2025 music, but I'm a bit stumped."

    "post_text": "Kylie Minogue was in a tricky position at the turn of the millennium. She had spent most of the 90s fighting for more creative control over her music and trying to shake off her bubblegum pop image, which resulted in arguably the most interesting music of her career but also a decline in commercial success. 1997\u2019s *Impossible Princess*, an eclectic and experimental album that has since been critically reappraised, suffered from a disjointed release and a lukewarm reception from the press and public. At the age of 29, there was a feeling that her career my be over.\n\nCue \u2018Spinning Around\u2019. From the start of the video, in which Kylie twirls onto the dancefloor in a pair of strappy heels and gold lam\u00e9 hotpants, it\u2019s clear that this is a wholesale return to dance-pop. The synths come in, the strings offer a salvo, and the next three-and-a-half minutes are pulsing disco heaven. The single debuted at number one in Australia and the UK, and Kylie was **back**. Its parent album *Light Years* was a triumph, it was followed up with *Fever*, and you know the rest. \n\nThe song was partially written by Paula Abdul, who based it on her divorce from Brad Beckerman and originally intended to include it in her next studio album; when this didn\u2019t materialise it was given to Kylie. \n\nThe famous hotpants were bought for fifty pence from a flea market, and Kylie\u2019s appearance in them in the video caused a media frenzy. Rumours were spread that she had undergone plastic surgery to enhance her bottom, that she had had it insured for five million pounds, and *The Sun* ran a campaign to have it designated an area of outstanding natural beauty. While Kylie appears to have taken this in good humour publicly, I find it hard to believe that all of the attention was welcome. Nevertheless, the gold dress she wore for the penultimate \u2018Studio 54\u2019 section of her Golden Tour, which included \u2018[Spinning Around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih3M93helUg)\u2019 (as well as this *excellent* version of '[The Loco-Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtpQVtdhOvY&list=RDRtpQVtdhOvY&start_radio=1)'), was clearly an affectionate nod to the outfit.\n\nWhat do you think? Were you around to witness Kylie\u2019s resurgence in person? Do you think she was unfairly treated in the 90s? Does the reaction to the \u2018Spinning Around\u2019 video tie into current conversations about female sexuality in music? Is it the bop to end all bops?"

Same with Green Day and \"American Idiot\", and while I enjoy those songs I couldn't help but think that if they were released today they would probably be endlessly mocked or viewed through the lens of \"they really think they did something there\" type of derision the internet loves. I even question if a Sam Cooke style \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" ballad might be dismissed as idealistic. \n\nDo you think it a protest song could break through in today's environment? "

    "post_text": "Released on June 28, 2024, C,XOXO marked as Cabello\u2019s fourth studio album. It also marked her first album with Geffen and Interscope Records after her departure with Epic Records. C,XOXO was a pop and alt-pop album incorporated with hyperpop, dance, and hip-hop genres. The deluxe, titled C,XOXO, Magic City Edition, was released on September 6, 2024.\n\nThe first single, I Luv It, was released on March 27, 2024 and featured Playboi Carti and sampled Gucci Mane\u2019s Lemonade from its chorus. The song is about, as it says in the title, liking someone a lot. The second single, He Knows, was released on May 10, 2024, and was a feature with Lil Nas X, and is about an interaction with a man at the club. The third single, Chanel No. 5, was released on June 21, 2024, and is about Cabello gaining sexual power through the sense, playing on many reviews which call the smell \u201cthe purest essence of femininity.\u201d The fourth single, Hot Uptown, was released on June 28, 2024, and was a feature with Drake and is about Drake exploring themes of love, desire, and reconciliation amidst luxury and materialism while Cabello talks about expressing longing and a desire to rekindle love, particularly when things get heated uptown. The fifth single, Godspeed, was released on September 6, 2024, and was about letting go of suffering and toxic relationships and people in your life and protecting yourself.\n\nThe album itself is heavily debated among critics and listeners alike. What are your thoughts and memories of C,XOXO? What are your favorite songs from C,XOXO?"

    "post_text": "\n\u2022 10 years ago, Demi Lovato released the lead single \u201cCool for the Summer\u201d from their Grammy-nominated album \u2018Confident.\u2019\n\n\u2022 It peaked at #11 on the Hot 100 for two weeks and is certified 4x Platinum by RIAA whilst also peaking at #7 on the UK singles chart. It went viral on Tiktok in 2022 and debuted on the new Billboard Global charts amongst other international placements. It currently has over 525 million views on Youtube and over 938 million streams on Spotify being\n\n\u2022 This song has always felt it played to all of demi\u2019s strengths as an artist. The edgy guitar kind of harkens back to her pop/rock days early on whilst still having a killer hook and pop sensibilities, the production is brash and loud but works because demi always gives an insane vocal performance and needs the production to match up. The lyrics are insanely fun to sing along to whilst also touching on demi\u2019s personal life which she never has issues singing about, definitely one of Max\u2019s best creations especially in the context of Demi\u2019s career.\n\nHow do we feel about CFTS now?\n\nDo you still listen to/use the song?\n\nShould Demi work with Max Martin and Savan Kotcha again?"

Very little of that sound \n\nthat said, I AM excited for Period, but would have been interesting to see Kesha do a Fever Ray-like album\n\nWho else teased a \"look what I can do if it drew me artistically!\" on an album/single?   \n"

    "post_text": "10 years ago, Carly Rae Jepsen released EMOTION... in Japan. The rest of the world had to wait another month till August 21st to hear the new pop gospel being preached. As many of y'all will know, this worldwide release led to the eventual creation of r/popheads as well as modern pop music. For this 10 year anniversary (of the subreddit and the worldwide release) we have multiple things planned, including a detailed writeup on the album and its impact. But we want to announce the rest a little bit closer to the actual events. So stay tuned and get excited as we prepare to celebrate 10 years of popheads!\n\nFor now, please enjoy the \"fresh\" anniversary thread: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1ljcgax/carly_rae_jepsen_emotion_happy_10_years_from_the/)"

    "post_text": "Whenever pop stars make something risky or experimental, it backfires. I'm not saying this in a \"they tried a new genre\" or \"they reinvented themselves\", I am saying this in a different kind of, never heard before sound kind of way. \nWhen Lady Gaga made Artpop she received so much backlash for it. Lorde released Solar Power and the hate it got made her life miserable. Kylie Minogue released Impossible Princess (and even though it is well appreciated now) it got such mixed reviews.Madonna's American Life was so badly received, but she tried so many new things on it. Charli xcx's Vroom Vroom was said to be unserious and \"like a joke\". \n\nOfcourse this does not always happen. Lana tries new sounds (atleast new to the mainstream) all the time and they seem to get love. Charli xcx's Charli was well received (but ofcourse only after Vroom Vroom was shitted upon). Whatever new weird (in the best way possible) stuff Bjork releases always seem to get love. \n\nWhy does this happen? Are those albums genuinely terrible? What are albums like these that you love? "

    "post_text": "I see this so much recently and had to actually devote time to reading about it and finding out why it feels so wrong. We have the following scenario: \n\nAn artist releases an album that\u2019s objectively and measurably very weak in any regard, let\u2019s say songwriting or production, let\u2019s assume the weakness is just there and undoubtable by musical criteria.\n\nYou criticize that rightfully (even as a fan) and that would indeed be the point of art criticism, because you point out something valid and not just an unfair/snarky personal opinion.\n\nThe immediate counter-argument that pops up, usually by fans is \u201cbut that\u2019s the point!\u201d or \u201cbut it was intentional!\u201d, \u201cthe messy production is purposeful and reflects the deep chaos in their current life\u201d etc. \n\nThis is called an \u201cintentional fallacy\u201d and has several issues:\n\n-firstly I don\u2019t have to know the inner intentions of an artist to criticize a ready and done artwork that exists independent of them, after being put out to the world\n\n-secondly, this is an unprovable claim; it might have been intentional but 50% it might also have been not\n\n-thirdly it\u2019s not even a core engaging with the criticism itself, just an invalidation/deflection technique \n\nthere are many more reasons but you get it\n\nWe pop fans severely need to stop doing that, it\u2019s lazy logically and philosophically and doesn\u2019t do anything for deepening the art analysis and discussion itself. \n\nLet me know if you can think of any recent examples, where this has frustrated you recently "
